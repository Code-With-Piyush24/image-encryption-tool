# Image Encryption and Decryption using Python 🛡️

## 📌 Project Summary

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective method of encrypting and decrypting digital images using Python and the Pillow (PIL) library. The approach involves pixel-level manipulation, specifically through two techniques:

1. **Color Channel Swapping** – Red and Blue channels are interchanged.
2. **Mathematical Transformation** – Each pixel's RGB values are altered using a user-defined key.

These methods provide a basic understanding of how image data can be secured or obfuscated, which is fundamental in the field of Cybersecurity.
